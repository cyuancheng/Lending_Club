## Capstone Project 1 
## Default and Investment Return Prediction in Online Peer-to-Peer Lending

### Background
Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is the new practice of lending money to individuals or small businesses via online service that matches lenders with borrowers. [Lending Club (LC)](https://www.lendingclub.com/) is the worldâ€™s largest P2P lender according to their issued loan volume and revenue. However, in contract with the traditional investment, P2P lending presents a higher credit risk, because the borrower has a higher chance to not pay off his/her loan, leading to the loan default. This motivates us to build machine-learning models to predict the credit risk and optimal investment return with the LC historical loan dataset. 


### Goal
The goal of this project is to answer the following answers:
- What are the key attributes for a successful P2P loan investment?
- How can we use data to help investors to reduce their investment risk and increase their return?
- What is the optimal return can investors expect from the P2P loan investment?
