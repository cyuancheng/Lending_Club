# Investment Return and Default Prediction in Online Peer-to-Peer Lending
### Capstone Project 1 (Springboard - Data Science Career Track)
Chiyuan Cheng (05/2020)

### Summary
- Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is the new practice of lending money to individuals or small businesses via online service that matches lenders with borrowers. 
- [Lending Club (LC)](https://www.lendingclub.com/) is the worldâ€™s largest P2P lender according to their issued loan volume and revenue. However, in contract with the traditional investment, P2P lending presents a higher credit risk, because the borrower has a higher chance to not pay off his/her loan, leading to the loan default. This motivates us to build machine-learning models to predict the credit risk and optimal investment return with the LC historical loan dataset.
